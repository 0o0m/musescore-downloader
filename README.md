## About

Musescore Pro ($6.99/mo) is required to download sheet music from musescore.com recently.  
(However, a few months ago, it was free to download.)

The Musescore company said that this is about copyright and licensing, and they must pay to the copyright owners.

Many musics on musescore.com are already in the **Public Domain**, that means either the author posted them in Public Domain, or the author has been dead for over 70 years.   
Do they need to pay to those composers who died hundreds of years ago?  
*Update: sheets in Public Domain are able to be downloaded without Musescore Pro now, but we still need an account to access them.*

Also, there are many sheet music authors on musescore.com who created their own songs and posted them under [CC-BY-**NC** (Creative Commons Attribution-**NonCommercial**) License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).  
Is it illegal that they sell them for **profit**?  
*Note: Putting ads (to sell Musescore Pro) on the website also means that they use it to generate revenue.*

This is absolutely not acceptable, and the only purpose is to profit from stealing.

There is an article on their website: [Score download becomes a part of the Pro subscription](https://musescore.com/groups/improving-musescore-com/discuss/5044610)

## About DMCA

To the Musescore company:  
If you want to DMCA take down this repo,  
Could you imagine that your website is taken down because you disobey the principles of Public Domain and Creative Commons?

**Also, I will launch an open source, serverless, and totally free version of musescore.com.**

PS: There is no problem that you get money by doing piano tutorials.

PPS: Thank you for your [react-native-musescore](https://github.com/Xmader/react-native-musescore) project.

## 关于

在 musescore.com 上下载曲谱需要支付 Musescore Pro 了，  
这种吸引人气后再对原来免费的东西收费的盈利模式十分令人反感，  
并且也违反了曲谱作者发布时的许可证协议（通常是 [CC-BY-NC 署名-非商业使用](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)，平台网站却将其作商业使用）
